The actor never married nor had children, but he did have a number of <a class=hm-link href=#>high-profile relationships with fellow famous actors</a> and had been engaged twice in his life.</p><p id=e-HFvs6oPBw data-wc=59>His first engagement was with Mean Girls star Lizzy Caplan.

In more recent years, Matthew got engaged to his girlfriend <a class=hm-link href=#>Molly Hurwitz</a> in November 2020, a year after they began dating. In 2021, however, the couple parted ways.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27b896c48142-lizzy-caplan-matthew-perry.jpg><p id=eMKE-5WJmD data-wc=34>Molly reacted to her former fiancé's death, writing in part: "No one in my adult life has influenced me more deeply than Matthew Langford Perry. I'm profoundly grateful for everything our relationship taught me."</p><p id=eeKDla18txD data-wc=42>Elsewhere in Matthew's family, he had a close bond with his parents. His mother, <a class=hm-link href=#>Suzanne Marie Morrison</a>, raised him mostly by herself in Canada. She previously worked as a journalist and was the former press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d829d0271698-matthew-perry-mom-suzanne-sister-emily.jpg><p id=emRCEYQEmhD data-wc=50>Matthew's dad is actor <a class=hm-link href=#>John Bennet Perry</a> – who even had a cameo in Friends – but he and Suzanne split when Matthew was one year old.

Jennifer is thought to be single currently, however, she has been married twice and remains on friendly terms with both of her ex-husbands, Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.</p><p id=eG89EzU36qxy data-wc=61>The star admitted to Elle in 2018 that she hadn't ruled out motherhood or finding love again. Jennifer said: "Who knows what the future holds in terms of a child and a partnership – how that child comes in… or doesn't? And now with science and miracles, we can do things at different times than we used to be able to."</p><p id=ec_Dv9jlYIOc data-wc=42>The actress is kept company by her dogs, Schnauzer mix Clyde and Pitbull Sophie, who she shares with ex-husband Justin.

Away from the cameras, the actor was previously in a relationship with TV producer Aurora Mulligan, who he met on the set of Top Gear. Aurora is believed to be 17 years younger than Matt and was born in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. In 2022, it was reported that they had split after almost six years of dating.</p><p id=epFW3vAnDDDr data-wc=36>Matt was previously married to American model Melissa McKnight from 2003 until 2006, and they share a 19-year-old daughter together, Marina.

Matt told Ellen: "I was filming in London for Top Gear and James Burrows was in town – the director who directed the first episode of Friends. He had tickets to see [Bruce] Springsteen at Wembley Stadium – who he's friends with, so he invited me to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3cda8f7a8039-matt-leblanc-and-aurora.jpg><p id=eZzEwzCknvNL data-wc=60>"Since my daughter and stepdaughter were in town, we all went to the gig.
