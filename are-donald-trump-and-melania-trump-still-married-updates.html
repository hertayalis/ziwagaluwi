It’s left many wondering if they’re still together.</span></p><h2><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Are Donald Trump and Melania Still Married?</span></h2><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Rumors that Donald and Melania are divorcing or have divorced have been flying for years now. Lately though, Melania’s <a href=#>conspicuous lack of appearances</a> with Donald has added extra fuel to the firestorm of speculation about their marital status.&nbsp;</span><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">It has become such a thing that during Donald’s visit to Iowa in September 2023, a banner reading “Where’s Melania?” was flown over the football stadium where he was attending a game.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Neither Donald nor Melania has officially addressed the status of their marriage. However, during a Meet the Press interview in September 2023, Donald said the public would see Melania “pretty soon.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">“Yes. Soon?” he said. “Yeah, pretty soon. When it’s appropriate, but pretty soon. <a href=#>She’s a private person</a>, a great person, a very confident person and she loves our country very much. And honestly, I like to keep her away from it. It’s so nasty and so mean.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Are-Donald-Trump-and-Melania-Trump-Still-Married-1.jpg><p>However, Melania was not pictured in photos from the Trump family’s Christmas celebrations in December 2023. Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald’s son Donald Jr., gave fans a peek at the family’s holidays by sharing a photo via her Instagram Story on Tuesday, December 26. Donald Sr. stood in front of a Christmas tree at his Mar-a-Lago resort next to sons Donald Jr. and Barron, as well as daughters Ivanka and Tiffany. Also included in the picture were Ivanka’s husband, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong>, and their three kids, as well as Tiffany’s spouse, <strong>Michael Boulos</strong>, and Kimberly. Melania did not appear in the photograph, according to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><h2><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Are Donald Trump and Melania Still Together?</span></h2><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Donald and Melania married in January 2005 and, by all accounts (or lack of accounts to the contrary), have been married ever since. Melania is his third wife.&nbsp;</span><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">As recently as October 7, 2023, Donald referred to Melania as his wife — and a “wonderful” one at that. During a campaign rally he spoke about the advice she gives him.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">“You know my wife,” he said during a campaign rally. “I have a wonderful wife, the great first lady, who’s very popular. She says, ‘Darling, I don’t like when you do the weightlifting thing or even the swimming thing because it doesn’t look presidential. I said, ‘let me tell you it’s much easier to look presidential than it is to do the schtick that I have to do at these places.’ And she doesn’t like when I dance a little bit going off.”</span></p><h2><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Is Melania Trump Supporting Donald During His Trials?</span></h2><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">It’s hard to know how much support Melania is giving Donald as he faces a plethora of criminal charges. She didn’t make an appearance during his arraignment hearings for the felonies of which he’s been accused, neither has she shown her face so far at the $250 million civil fraud trial in New York in which Donald’s facing charges for inflating the value of his assets in order to gain business advantages.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Of course, just because she he isn’t there by his side physically doesn’t mean she’s not providing emotional support behind the scenes.&nbsp;</span><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">But could she be supportive during another upcoming trial Donald’s facing for allegedly paying <a href=#><strong>Stormy Daniels</strong></a> <a href=#>“hush money” after their alleged affair</a>? While Melania has stood by Donald despite numerous <a href=#>allegations</a> of infidelity and sexual misconduct over the years, there’s speculation <a href=#>the Stormy case may be the tipping point</a> that prompts Melania to walk.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Are-Donald-Trump-and-Melania-Trump-Still-Married-5.jpg><h2><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Do Melania and Donald Trump Have a Prenup?</span></h2><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yes, by all accounts, Melania and Donald put a prenup in place when they married. However, there have been reports over the years that <a href=#>Melania has renegotiated it to protect her</a> and <a href=#>Barron</a>. In the book, “The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump,” <strong>Mary Jordan</strong> claims that’s why Melania delayed her move to D.C. after Donald was elected president.&nbsp;</span><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">“She wanted proof in writing that when it came to financial opportunities and inheritance, Barron would be treated as more of an equal to Trump’s oldest three children,” Jordan wrote of Melania and the couple’s only son, Barron Trump.</span></p><p><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">An insider told Page Six, “Over the last year, Melania and her team have been quietly negotiating a new ‘postnup’ agreement between herself and Donald Trump.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ogsc="rgb(0, 0, 0)">The source said the renegotiation isn’t because she’s necessarily preparing to divorce Donald. But, given all the legal bills and charges, she wants to make sure she and Barron fare well financially, no matter what happens next.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJomKudXZm8r63LnWStqqWivW6tzZ1kpp2clruqrYytqa6loGLAtbXLpWSmmaKntqawjK6nnZmkmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-was-john-travolta-in-grease.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How old was John Travolta in Grease?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-mouthful-of-air-review-1235098605.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Mouthful of Air Review: Amanda Seyfried Spirals in Oblique Mental Health Portrait</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
