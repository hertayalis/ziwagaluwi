He was a cast member of the popular Disney Pixar film<i> Finding Dory</i>. He did the voice of <i>Nemo</i> in the film. Some of the other popular cast members of the film are Andrew Staton, Ellen DeGeneres, and Willem Dafoe.</p><p>Rolence was also the voice of <i>Nemo</i> in the video game <i>Finding Dory: Just Keep Swimming</i>.

It hasn't been long since he turned eighteen, so getting into a relationship is probably the least of his worries. He is focused on his acting career and enjoying life with his family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/24/15624087_244843019283250_2931054874437091328_n%20(1)-1674545162517.jpg><p>Rolence gained fame at a very young age, which comes with a price. He probably didn't have a normal childhood like the other kids. He was hanging out with a lot of people older than him, so he probably didn't have a lot of friends growing up. We have to wait and see when he will get into a relationship with someone.</p><h2>Hayden Rolence's Net Worth</h2><p><i>Finding Dory </i>voice-over artist Hayden Rolence has an estimated net worth of <strong>$1 Million</strong>. Movies are his biggest source of income. <i>Finding Dory</i> is easily the most successful movie he has been involved with. Not only movie was highly rated, but it also made a lot of money. The film had a box office collection of<strong> $486.2 Million</strong>, making it one of the most successful animated films ever.</p><p>Besides that, Hayden is also worked on video games like <i>Finding Dory: Just Keep Swimming and Disney Infinity 3.0. </i>All these works are the reason behind his millionaire status at such a young age.</p><h2>Rolence Sister Is A Golfer</h2><p>Rolence has a sister, <strong>Meadow Rolence</strong>,<strong> </strong>who is a golfer. She chose to take a completely different career path than her brother. She started playing golf at seven, and her golfing career has only been going uphill since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/24/118771972_796320004450248_5276408119868903150_n%20(1)-1674545309834.jpg><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Chicago Tribune</i></a> has mentioned some of her golfing accomplishments in its article. Meadow&nbsp;has been the number-one golfer for the Mustangs. She has also previously finished as a runner-up in the Matea tournament. She has a lot of potentials, and if she continues like this, she will achieve much more. Rolence himself is also posting about his sister a lot on his Instagram.</p><h2>Parents Details</h2><p>Hayden is the son of <strong>Jason Rolence</strong> and <strong>Marlene Prelesnik Rolence</strong>. He is known for being an obedient and sweet child, and you can thank his parents for raising him well. Both live private lives, but what they do for a living remains known.</p><p>Hayden's parents live a normal life and are away from social media. It isn't much available on his father, but his mother, Marlene, is on Instagram but isn't very active on the platform. Hayden&nbsp;has also hardly uploaded pictures of his parents on his platform.</p><h2>Charity Involvements</h2><p>Hayden loves helping people and has been involved with the charity.

In the case of Rolence's character <i>Nemo</i>, he has a physical disability in his fin. The film was about accepting each other despite their differences, and Lucky Fin Project tries to do the same with kids born with limb differences.</p><p>Hayden&nbsp;has also been involved with another charity called Feed My Starving Children during <i>Finding Dory's </i>promotion. The charity is involved with providing food to people in developing nations.</p><h2>Loves Baseball And Supports Chicago Cubs</h2><p><i>Cicero in Winter </i>actor, Rolence loves baseball like most Americans.
