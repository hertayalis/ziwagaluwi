His first appearances in broadcasting were in the UK, where he had a spot as a regular comedian and panelist on the BBC Radio 4 show "Loose Ends" in the early '90s. Norton began to gain public attention when he filled in for a late-night TV talk show host and hosted a quiz show, "Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment". He also appeared in the Channel 4 series "Father Ted." He got his chat shows, "So Graham Norton" and "V Graham Norton", on Channel 4, and eventually moved to the United States in 2004 to continue his career.

He also hosted the Saturday night reality TV series "Strictly Dance Fever" on BBC One. During this time, Norton also hosted various other shows for the BBC including "When Will I Be Famous?"

He lost half of his blood and almost did not survive the attack. He said an elderly couple found him and said they saved his life after they called an ambulance for him.
