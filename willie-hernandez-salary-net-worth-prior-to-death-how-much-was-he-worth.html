One of the top bullpen relievers of his day amassed his fortune mostly via his professional baseball career.</strong></p><p>During the 1970s and 1980s, players were underpaid; but, as a great player, Willie was richly compensated. In addition, after retiring from professional football, he owned and ran some businesses. Guillermo Hernandez Villanueva, a late Puerto Rican baseball relief pitcher, was the eighth child of Dinicio and Dominga.</p><p>He began his career as a third baseman and outfielder before transitioning to pitching. Hernandez was signed as an amateur free agency by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1973 and spent time in the minor levels before being picked in the 1976 Rule 5 draft by the Chicago Cubs. The Phillies traded him to the Detroit Tigers on March 24, 1984, and he guided the Tigers to the World Series triumph. Following his triumph, he was named American League Cy Young Award winner as well as American League Most Valuable Player.</p><h2>Mr. Willie Hernandez Net Worth As A Result Of Salary, Contract, And Income</h2><p>Willie Hernandez began his professional baseball career with the Philadelphia Phillies in the minor leagues. In the minor levels, he played for the Single-A Spartanburg Phillies, Double-A Reading Reading Phillies, and Triple-A Oklahoma City 89ers. In the 1970s and 1980s, minor league players were paid pennies.</p><p>According to sources, the minimum monthly salary for minor-league players on big-league contracts was around $1000. Hernandez very definitely got a larger monthly compensation, most likely in the $2000-3000 range, which was far greater than the minimum wage.</p><p>Using the same rates, he should make around $100,000 in his three years in the minor leagues, less the $25,000 signing bonus. Later, when he joined the Cubs, his starting salary was around $19,000, rising to somewhere between $90,000 and $100,000. His salary with the Phillies for the 1983 season, however, is unclear.</p><p>The next season, he signed with the Tigers. In January 1985, he agreed to a four-year, $4.65 million contract extension. His salary for the 1985 season was $660,000, which grew to $960,000 for the 1986 season. Over the next several seasons, his earnings increased dramatically, reaching $1,060,000 in 1987, $1,210,000 in 1988, and $1,310,000 in 1989.</p><p>In addition, after retiring from professional baseball, he developed and led a steel construction firm in Puerto Rico. Hernandez eventually sold his construction company and started a cattle ranch. These businesses also brought him money. Guillermo Hernandez Villanueva was claimed to have a net worth of $1.5 million before his death.</p><h2>Mr. Willie Hernandez, passed away at the age of 69.</h2><p>The 13-year major league veteran died at the age of 69 after a long battle with heart illness. He was claimed to have suffered heart problems for over 15 years.</p><p>Hernandez almost died in 2007 after throwing the first pitch of the Tigers’ first season while having a pacemaker placed in his heart. Following his death, Major League Baseball and his former team, the Detroit Tigers, shared their condolences on Twitter. They also sent their sympathies to the grieving family, friends, and teammates.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Baseball Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Tresa And Robert Hagen Son Nicholas Hagen | Family And Ethnicity</a></h3>The exceptional football player has garnered the interest of numerous supporters across the globe.
