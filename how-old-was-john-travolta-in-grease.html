Most of the time, these actors are heavily placed under the microscope whenever they’re playing characters who are obviously supposed to be younger than them. Simply put, there’s seemingly nothing more wild than watching an adult actor portray a teenager in a movie. But for those familiar with the Hollywood umbrella, it happens more often than you might think.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Specifically, this exact situation has been constantly examined during the ever-popular&nbsp;1978 musical <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grease</a></strong>. As die-hard supporters of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the engaging musical</a> already know, most of the actors and actresses portraying the teenagers at Rydell High School were much older than the characters they were portraying. More specifically, folks took obvious notice of star <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Travolta</a></strong> — but considering how often we see the hip-swinger in the film, that’s hardly a major surprise.</p><h2 id=h-john-travolta-s-real-age-and-character-age-in-grease-explained data-injectable=false>John Travolta’s real age and character age in Grease explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/grease-sandy-olivia-newton-john-amc-1-e1697552481154.jpg><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true>Interestingly enough, Travolta was amongst the youngest members of the Grease cast. Born on Feb. 18, 1954, Travolta was only 23 years old during filming for the movie in 1977. With that being said, Travolta’s character of Danny Zuko — widely known as the leader of the T-Bird group and resident bad boy — was actually an 18-year-old senior attending Rydell High with the rest of his friends. Drawing up the math, Travolta was actually 5 years older than his Grease character — which certainly isn’t an uncommon trend in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Due to child labor laws, it’s much easier and more effective for directors, producers, and studios alike to hire adult actors and actresses to portray younger characters. Of course, shows such as Stranger Things have managed to make the former concept work in its favor, but back in the ‘70s, the landscape of children working on sets was much different than what it is today.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=false>Even at just 23 years old at the time of filming, Travolta had already easily become a household name thanks to his breakthrough role in 1977’s Saturday Night Fever just a year earlier. So when the time came for the starring roles in Grease to be promptly cast, it was obvious that the creators behind the project needed to look no further than a young and talented Travolta — who was undoubtedly the hottest working actor in Hollywood at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnWmqpmop%2Bdu27A0ZqtqKSklnqquoygqZ6Zo5p8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carolyn-manno.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Let's Focus on Carolyn Manno</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-donald-trump-and-melania-trump-still-married-updates.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Donald Trump and Melania Trump Still Married?
