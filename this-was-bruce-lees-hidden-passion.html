He wrote — not school notes, because he famously had trouble at school and eventually dropped out — but to jot down his ideas on martial arts, Eastern philosophy, kung fu principles, and even drew fighting style diagrams. These notebooks were integral to creating his own martial art style, Jeet Kune Do, and helped him cope with the many thoughts in his head. It was in these notebooks where Lee sometimes wrote his poems.</p><p>Lee wanted people to think about his different philosophies and apply these to their lives, his <a href=#>official website</a> said. He believed people, in life and in fighting, should be like water –formless and adaptable. He also said you have to be a practical dreamer but also take action, research your own experience, and understand that having no limits is a limitation. Lee had many philosophies that he wove into his teachings.</p><p>His passion for philosophy was evident early on. While still a student in Seattle, he started writing a book on kung fu. He even added photos of him demonstrating stances that he first figured out on his notebooks. Later, this guided him when he was teaching his celebrity students.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlW1nbW9fqbWqv4ywmKxlkqfCpLGMpZyeq12dtqWwxKdkqZmjqLawuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tucker-beck.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tucker Beck Died: Know Everything About His Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-untold-truth-of-bradley-coopers-ex-jennifer-esposito.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Untold Truth Of Bradley Cooper's Ex Jennifer Esposito</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
