False death rumors have been a problem on <a href=#>TikTok</a> in the past, but these tributes don't seem to be fake. Rumors suggest that Gabe, who went by gabenotbabe on TikTok, died on Sept. 26.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to gabenotbabe?</h2><p>Although there has not yet been any official confirmation of his death, reports suggest that he died following a car accident in San Antonio, Texas. In spite of the lack of confirmation, many have suggested that Gabe's close friends and family have been posting about his death online. One user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@rickyfloreess</a>, who was one of Gabe's best friends, has posted several tributes to him since the news of his death broke.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe </a>page has also been set up that is called “Gabe’s Memorial Fund", and has already raised more than $10,000. Gabe's death has clearly hit his fans hard. He was beloved by many on TikTok and around the internet, perhaps especially by those who only knew him because of his online presence. “My heart sank when I saw his best friend post about him. He was way too young to go," one person wrote. "May God bless, heal and protect his family and friends.”</p><p>“Knowing you can lose a loved one in a blink of an eye is heartbreaking. Rest easy beautiful angel," another person added.</p><p>“Life is crazy. Never take anything for granted and appreciate people around you," a third wrote.</p><p>Gabe had amassed more than 1 million followers on TikTok and had almost 80 million likes across his videos on the platform. He also had a sizeable following of several hundred thousand on Instagram.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This is not the first car accident to lead to the death of a TikTok creator.</h2><p>In part because such a wide variety of people have gained a following on TikTok, TikTok users have to grieve creators who die too soon at a somewhat alarming rate. Just recently,<a href=#> Timbo the redneck</a>, a content creator from Florida who was known for his redneck sketches, died in a motorbike accident in August.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ricky Flores (@rickyfloreess)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>These kinds of tragedies happen all too often, and TikTok users are forced to remember creators whose content they've loved. Of course, these deaths are even worse for the people who knew them well in real life. On TikTok, though, users can take some comfort in one another, and in the knowledge that they weren't the only people who loved a specific creator.</p><p>Those who followed Gabe or Timbo may not have had a personal relationship with them in the way that the people who knew them personally did, but TikTok can allow users to feel remarkably close to the people they follow. This is especially true for creators who share aspects of their lives or take their personal experiences and turn them into content that their followers might enjoy. Gabe and Tim are gone too soon, but their followers will certainly miss them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6jsYysmKWZqpa%2FbsDIpKuoo12Yrra%2FxGamn2WUmq61tA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./seagate-barracuda-pro-12tb-hdd-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Seagate BarraCuda Pro 12TB HDD Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rolonda-watts-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rolonda Watts Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
