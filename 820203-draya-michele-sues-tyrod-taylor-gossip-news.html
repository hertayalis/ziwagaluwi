Allegedly, he verbally agreed to let Draya buy it from him eventually, and that any improvements she made to the home would go towards its final price. She went on to make an offer of $2.8M, and when he countered with $3.2M, she accepted. Draya then claims to have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">put $300K into work on the home</a>, while under the assumption that it would go toward what she agreed to pay.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-draya-michele-accuses-tyrod-taylor-of-breach-of-contract>Draya Michele Accuses Tyrod Taylor Of Breach Of Contract</h2></span><p>American football player Tyrod Taylor and model Draya Michele guests at the Dolce and Gabbana x Persol party of the Milan Fashion Week Men's Collection Spring Summer 2023.
