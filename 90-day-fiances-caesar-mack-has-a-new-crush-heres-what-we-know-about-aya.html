The two are newly talking, but Caesar is already smitten with the latest lady in his life.</p><p>Fans first met Caesar during Season 3 of the TLC hit show. His story with a woman named Maria was one hot topic among 90 Day Fiance fans.</p><p>Caesar gave Maria thousands of dollars before they ever met in person. His friends and family were convinced Caesar was being catfished.</p><p>In the season finale, viewers were finally given a glimpse of Maria. She admitted she was not attracted to Caesar and was talking to other men.</p><h2>Caesar drops two bombshells on 90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined</h2><p>Caesar appeared on <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined to give fans an update</a>&nbsp;about his life. He dropped two truth bombs on fans.</p><p>One was that he did go to Ukraine to meet Maria in person after the TLC show ended.&nbsp;Not only did Caesar get the closure he needed from Maria, but that allowed him to move on with someone new.</p><p>Oh yes, Aya is his new woman, even though they have yet to meet in person. Caesar and Aya met via Facebook and have been talking for a couple of months.</p><p>Unlike Maria, Aya lives in New Orleans, so she is in the same country as Caesar. The two even went on a virtual date during the episode. He set the mood with wine, chocolate, strawberries, and whipped cream. She baked him a cake with his name and a heart in red icing.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-88h2aAfbn/</p><h2>Who is Caesar’s new crush Aya?</h2><p>Aya is a beautiful model, who is significantly younger than Caesar. He is 46, and she is only 21.</p><p>According to her Instagram bio, Aya calls herself a beauty and fashion model. Her Instagram feed is filled with photos of herself showing off her assets.</p><p>All of Aya’s social media accounts promote her modeling career. This includes her Facebook page, the place she met Caesar. Other than details about her career, not a lot is known about Aya.</p><p>Social media is unconvinced Caesar is not headed for another heartbreak. One thing fans could not stop talking about is the resemblance between Aya and <a href=#>90 Day Fiance alum Larissa Lima.</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aya is like a Larissa on Xanax.<br>And Caesar just fed her a virtual strawberry wtf…. <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a> <a href=#>#90DayFianceSelfQuarantined</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lZ3oZ2uYHx</a></p><p>— 90 Day Cray (@90DayCray) <a href=#>May 5, 2020</a></p><p>Still, the relationship is already off to a better start than his with Maria. Not only did Caesar and Aya have a virtual date that appeared to go as well as a virtual date can, but Aya has so far not asked Caesar for money.</p><p>There also seems to be chemistry between Aya and Caesar. Perhaps they will show up again soon on one of the 90 Day Fiance franchise shows.</p><p>90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined airs Mondays at 9/8c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ2lleqWt2GadopmemLK0ecKanKyZomK6oq%2FKZp%2Baq12Weq%2Bx1maaq62jnXqpsdGeqmavmJbBbsPEZqKnp6dirqO71K1kmrGRZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./635264-bam-margeras-wife-files-for-divorce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bam Margera's Wife Files For Divorce</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zendaya.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zendaya: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
