He was Superman in the DC Extended Universe, then he was let go. He became the titular character on Netflix’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher</a></strong>, but then he left the show when the chance to reprise his role as Superman came about – not that that was ever confirmed as the exact reasoning. Then, DC decided to recast the character, and Cavill was left in no man’s land: halfway between a comic book hero and a fantasy antihero.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>The back-and-forth between Cavill’s involvement with the DCEU and The Witcher has left some fans confused, and the confusion reached an apex when the trailer for the new season of the latter dropped. Cavill is featured prominently in the trailer, leading some to question whether Cavill had returned to the series. Is he back as Geralt of Rivia?</p><h2 id=h-will-henry-cavill-be-back-for-the-witcher-season-4 data-injectable=false>Will Henry Cavill be back for The Witcher season 4?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Sadly, the answer is no. Cavill has maintained his decision to leave the show, and the episodes featured in the trailer were shot before he left. The trailer also reveals that The Witcher season 3 will be broken up into two parts: Volume 1 (episodes 1-5) will be released globally on June 29, and Volume 2 (episodes 6-8) will follow suit on July 27.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>While the Superman confusion was one of the reasons Cavill may have left, it wasn’t the only one. The actor voiced his frustration with the writers and producers of The Witcher, and their seeming lack of concern with staying faithful to the source material.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>“I’m the most annoying guy on set because I’m saying, ‘Erm, excuse me, you do realize that this should be happening’ and ‘they wouldn’t do that’ and ‘you haven’t read this, then that means this would be impossible,’” Cavill <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Collider</a>. “And everyone’s just going, ‘Henry, just shut up and do the thing.’ And I’m like, ‘I don’t want to do the thing! Because he wouldn’t do it this way!’”</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Cavill’s performance was one of the most praised aspects of The Witcher when it debuted, and the reaction to his exit has been uniformly negative. There has even been a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan petition</a> asking that Netflix rehire the actor and fire the writing team who have seemingly taken the show in an unfaithful direction. The petition earned over 300,000 signatures.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Needless to say, Cavill’s replacement, Liam Hemsworth, has his work cut out for him. The actor was announced shortly after Cavill’s exit, and the initial response was mixed. Some felt that Hemsworth lacked the gravitas that his precedessor brought to the role, while others were more optimistic, and posited that a new Geralt would rejuvinate the show after a middling second season.</p><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=false>Those who swear by Cavill’s performance, though, will be getting a hell of a condolence prize: a brand new season of episodes. It’ll be strange to watch, knowing that he’s already gone, but at least it’ll help to smooth the transition from one era of the show to the other. It could have been a lot worse. Netflix could’ve reshot the season with Hemsworth, or gone for the same CGI nonsense that removed Cavill’s mustache in Justice League. I’d say we lucked out, all things considered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yhnKeqqWKwosLIpaNmmpGYuG6t0maroZ1drLa1r8eeqWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./620993-ja-morant-posters-jalen-smith-for-dunk-of-the-year-candidate.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ja Morant Posters Jalen Smith For Dunk Of The Year Candidate</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bts-taehyung-wins-hearts-as-he-flaunts-disneys-pride-collection-that-faced-backlash-from-anti-lgbtq-critics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BTS Kim Taehyung wins hearts as he flaunts Disneys Pride Collection that faced backlash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
