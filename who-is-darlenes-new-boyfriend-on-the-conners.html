Emily, of course. In her poem Love and Friendship, she writes, "Love is like the wild rose-briar / Friendship like the holly-tree ‚Äî / The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms / But which will bloom most constantly?"</p><p>We bring up dear Emily because once again <a href=#>Darlene</a> Conner has moved on in The Conners. But will this new man make a better friend or boyfriend? Who is Darlene's boyfriend on <a href=#>The Conners</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Darlene's boyfriend on 'The Conners'?</h2><p>We learned via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> that Darlene's new beau, played by Andrew Leeds, is only going to be sticking around for a three-episode arc. That doesn't bode ‚Äî or shall we say "beau'd"? ‚Äî well for their relationship. Can we even call it a relationship if he's only in her life for such a small amount of time? Emily Bront√´ asked, "Which will bloom most constantly?" In this case, we're leaning toward friendship.</p><p>Darlene's new man, Nick (played by Andrew Leeds), is the first person she's dated since her breakup with Ben (Jay R. Ferguson). Honestly, Nick sounds delightfully complicated and absolutely like the kind of guy you would happily let destroy you. In his former life, he was a stockbroker with a drug habit. Now, he's in a much better place, working at a Zen bookstore in Lanford. Wow, Lanford sure has changed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Andrew Leeds?</h2><p>Andrew comes from a strong comedy background. He was a member of the improvisation and sketch comedy theater The Groundlings. He's also been acting since he was a wee child. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway World,</a> Andrew explained that his shyness is what pushed him into acting. His mother signed him up for a musical theater group in Florida, where they lived, and he loved it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Groundlings</span></figure><p>His interest in The Groundlings was ignited by a show he saw in 2001. "I was mesmerized by their acting ability, and by their ability to transform into other characters in such a real way with such a strong point of view," he said. Andrew's love of character work is clear in his resume. He's had roles on everything from <a href=#>Bones</a> to <a href=#>Shameless</a> to <a href=#>Veep</a>.</p><p>Andrew's time at The Groundlings has really helped him shape every role he's stepped into. He credits the ability to fully inhabit each character to his instructors. "The teachers there are incredible. They care so much, and they really teach you how to look for a character's point of view," he said. Andrew always asks how a character would walk, talk, laugh, even cry.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>andrew leeds is in an episode of the mentalist, therefore you should watch it. i think i made my point.</p>‚Äî angel | Zoeys Christmas ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÅ‚ú® (@angelsplaylist) <a href=#>September 7, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@angelsplaylist</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Andrew Leeds was in an episode of Numbers playing a computer hacker <a href=#>#Bones</a></p>‚Äî Kathy Barnes (@Dukefan1982) <a href=#>September 4, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twittter/@Dukefan1982</span></figure><p>He's also been extremely lucky to work with a lot of heavy-hitters in the acting world, people who were generous with their time and talent. Growing up in the theater around people like Barbara Walsh, Heather MacRae, and Mandy Patinkin definitely left an "imprint" on him. And now he can carry that into Lanford, straight into Darlene's heart, for three episodes.</p><p>The Conners airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ2ZoqGyr7HSZqWer12XvLqy0aKcp5xdpLtuwMeeZJynnqOys78%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ed-westwick-switzerland-glacier-engagement-amy-jackson-ring-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ed Westwick reveals Switzerland glacier engagement to Amy Jackson and her ring is spellbinding</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ralo-why-is-ralofamgoon-in-jail-raalo-famgoon-prison-sentence-and-charges.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Ralofamgoon In Jail?
