The Puerto Rican TV reporter never provided any details about his ex- or current wives or girlfriends. Regrettably, there is no proof to indicate whether he is married or not. The fact that he has a son named Xavier Enrique Torres and a daughter named Layza Torres does indicate that he has had an affair in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/elvocero-1.jpg><p>Layza Torres, Ramon’s daughter, followed in her father’s footsteps and became a journalist as well.
