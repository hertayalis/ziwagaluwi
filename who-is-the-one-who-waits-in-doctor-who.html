As well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a companion from the classic series coming back</a>, we got <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor making his grand debut</a> as he took up the baton (or sonic screwdriver) from David Tennant’s Fourteen in a most unique fashion.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>What’s more, we also got Neil Patrick Harris playing the Toymaker, one of the most powerful villains in the Whoniverse’s pantheon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who hasn’t been seen on screen since 1966</a>. And yet, despite his immense reality-warping abilities, we learn in special 3, “The Giggle,” that there’s someone out there who’s even more powerful. So who is “The One Who Waits?”</p><h2 id=h-the-one-who-waits-sure-sounds-like-doctor-who-s-next-big-bad data-injectable=false>The One Who Waits sure sounds like Doctor Who‘s next big bad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/doctor-who-the-giggle-1.jpg><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>When playing a game of cards with the Doctor in the episode, the Toymaker makes clear that he’s serious business by listing off his impressive accomplishments.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>“I played them all, Doctor. I toyed with supernovas, turned galaxies into spin tops. I gambled with God and made him a jack-in-the-box. I made a jigsaw out of your history,” he intones. “The Master was dying and begged for his life with one final game and when he lost I sealed him for all eternity in my gold tooth.”</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>And yet, the Toymaker admits there’s one being in the whole universe that he fears. “There’s only one player I didn’t dare face, The One Who Waits,” he teases. “I saw it hiding and I ran. That’s someone else’s game.”</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Elsewhere in “The Giggle,” the Doctor describes the Toymaker as an “elemental force,” while the character himself reveals that his physical form is but “a face-concealing a vastness that will never cease.” In other words, this guy is a big deal, and yet this mysterious One Who Waits has even him sweating.</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>Seeing as this is the second time in three episodes that we’ve had an ominous bit of foreshadowing, presumably The One Who Waits is the same enigmatic foe that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Meep from “The Star Beast” described as “The Boss.”</a> At that point, we thought they were talking about the Toymaker himself, but clearly that’s not the case anymore. Although why a villain who terrifies a man who can gamble with God would hire a two-bit criminal like The Meep as his lackey is a whole other mystery.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=false>There are various cosmically powerful species from Doctor Who history that The One Who Waits could belong to — the Eternals spring to mind. No, not the Marvel ones; an ageless godlike race from the 1983 story “Enlightenment.” Although, having said that, The One Who Waits does have a very He Who Remains ring to it. If Ncuti Gatwa’s Time Lord teams up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Hiddleston’s Time God</a> in some future Loki crossover on Disney Plus, we will not complain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlpJ2ybrvNnmSwoJ9ixKK106xkoqZdmbykwM6rZLCgn2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./arthur-frederick-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Arthur Frederick - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-lori-anne-allison-doing-now-heres-how-johnny-depps-first-ex-wife-moved-on.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Lori Anne Allison doing now?
