While not all news about him is good, all news about him does have a relay point: Iowa Hawkeyes <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Wrestling</a>. Although AJ has made it explicitly known that he wants to be a Hawkeye, no developments have been seen in this direction so far.</span></p><p><span>After several days of ambiguity, however, Iowa Hawkeyes Wrestling’s head coach Tom Brands has finally spoken regarding the matter. A social media post showcased the latest take of Brands on the matter. However, from what he said, things don’t look good for the 2021 NCAA wrestling champ.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>AJ Ferrari’s wait not to end anytime soon?</span></strong></h2><p><span>FloWrestling recently added a video to its official X handle. The video carried a brief section of an interview with Tom Brands. The interviewer asked,&nbsp;</span><span>“Do you have any wrestlers joining the roster for the second semester?”</span><span>&nbsp;Answering the question, Brands said,&nbsp;</span><span>“We do not. At this moment.”</span><span>&nbsp;This comes as a wrecking ball on the hopes of the NCAA Wrestling champ.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>AJ Ferrari had officially visited several universities, with the University of Iowa being his final stop. His further social media updates almost guaranteed his acceptance into the wrestling program, especially since his brother Angelo has already committed to Iowa. But it seems that he will not be joining the Hawkeyes now.</span></p><p><span>Things were going smoothly for the 197-pounder till he got into a fight with Iowa’s Zach Glazier. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>While the fight started verbally</a>, it ended up with AJ flipping double birdies at Glazier. Tom Brands was very firm and curt with his response. However, he did split his sentences and mentioned ‘at this moment’ separately. Does this mean that there is still a chance for AJ Ferrari to join?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Loss of another year looms on 2021 NCAA Champ</span></strong></h2><p><span>While nothing is certain about the position of Iowa at the moment, AJ will need a clear answer or an NCAA team very soon. Because, if he doesn’t join a team soon, he may have to lose out on another year. This will add to his frustration since he hasn’t competed since 2022 after being ruled out due to a big injury.</span></p><p><strong>WATCH STORY – <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>I Can Wrestle With Anybody Anytime: The Unranked Purdue Wrestler Proved His Boast</a></strong></p><p><span>Reading the situation after his actions against Glazier, even AJ Ferrari made moves to urge colleges to approach him. However, the 2021 NCAA wrestling champion hasn’t received any success in the matter. Are all doors really closed for Mr. Fast Twitch in 2023 as well? What will happen if he fails to land a college team this year as well?</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SsZKyon6fBtHnNnq6sZaensrTAy6KloGWemsS0ecOrmKaZpJ6wbsDWoqqtZZmjeqe70aacq2WemK6iecKhmKaoXZa3brLEq6maqpmoeqfB066pnmWRqHqqu9aaZKGZp6CyurHSZpqomZOderW7zGaZq5memcBusNGop6xlkWKvsLnBrJ%2BepJxk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hanna-obbeek.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hanna Obbeek</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yusif-eyvazov.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yusif Eyvazov</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
