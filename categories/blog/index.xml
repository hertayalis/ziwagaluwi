Answer
The compressor is equipped with a valve that, when it leaks, might produce a faint hissing sound. Leaks in the valves must be repaired as quickly as possible since these valves are critical in the pressurisation of the refrigerant gas. The compressor hissing or screeching indicates a significant problem: it indicates that the pressure within the compressor has risen to an unsafe level.
In light of this, why does my air conditioner create a hissing noise?</description></item><item><title/><link>/post-4805.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post-4805.html</guid><description>„Å§„ÅÑ„Å´ÂÜçÁµêÊàê„Åô„Çã„Åì„Å®„Å´„Å™„Å£„Åü„Ç∑„É£„Ç∫„Éä„Åß„Åô„Åå„ÄÅ

Keeping your washing machine in an upright posture is always suggested for safety reasons. The inner and outer tubs of a washer might bump against each other when a washer is flipped on its side, causing support pads to become loose and the suspension to get damaged.
