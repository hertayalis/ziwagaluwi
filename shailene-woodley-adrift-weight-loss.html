In order to keep up with the limited calorie diet, the actress would typically skip dinner and limited her food intake.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I can't sleep when I'm hungry, so I would have a glass of wine to basically pass the f--k out," Shailene told the outlet. "For the last two weeks I had a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day," adding, "It was f--king miserable."&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Shailene was not having to undergo this transformation alone. "I don't know that I could do it without Sam," she said. "We both really were there for one another in our moments of extreme exhaustion and hunger." &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shailene added, "We were working extremely long hours out on the open sea. Sam and I were losing quite a bit of weight as we weren't eating much. ...So not having the fuel to run you physically, along with the emotional complexities that were incredibly taxing at times, mixed with the physicality, it could have been a grueling experience."&nbsp;</p><p>And, hunger pains were not the only thing the cast had to deal with.

"It’s so graphic. But I couldn’t quite get my body to throw up. When you’re seasick and finally able to throw up, you kind of get your footing again," she revealed (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>). "I wasn’t able to do that. It was just an all-day nausea and quite miserable."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Pretty much everybody&nbsp;threw up at least once," Sam added. Shailene noted that the anxious look on the actors' faces about the incoming hurricane are really the co-stars trying not to get sick on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>"What the audience sees in that scene is a&nbsp;look of nervousness,” she explained.&nbsp;“But it’s really Sam and I trying not puke when the cameras are rolling. It’s like, 'Keep it together.' That's pure anxiety.”&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Adrift on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWitcuepZ5lp6S8pbjEsmSanKKes7V51p6goKCkYrmwv9I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brush-with-the-best-detangling-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Hair Brush to Prevent Breakage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./in-the-lab-asrock-radeon-rx-5700-xt-taichi-x-8g-oc-graphics-card.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>ASRock Radeon RX 5700 XT Taichi X 8G OC+ Graphics Card</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
