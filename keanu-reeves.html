Since then, he has gone on to star in action and sci-fi movies such as Point Break, Speed, The Matrix, and more recently, the John Wick franchise.</p><p>Along with his acting career, Keanu is also known <a href=#>for his tragic past,</a> including the death of his best friend River Phoenix and his girlfriend Jennifer Syme, and <a href=#>his "lonely" persona</a>.</p><p>However, with over three decades in Hollywood, Keanu is not slowing down and is rumored to be <a href=#>playing a character in the Marvel Universe </a>despite having rejected multiple offers in the past. He also starred in <a href=#>John Wick: Chapter 4,</a> which was released on March 24, 2023. It's clear Keanu isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</p><h2>Where is Keanu Reeves from?</h2><p>Born in Beirut, Keanu's British mother, Patricia, was a costume designer, and his father, Samuel Reeves, was of Chinese-Hawaiian descent. Keanu grew up in Toronto, Canada and decided to become an actor at the age of 15, and two years later, he dropped out of high school. His first movie role was in the Youngblood in 1986, where he played a goalie.</p><h2>Is Keanu Reeves married? Does he have kids?</h2><p>No. Keanu was in a serious relationship with fellow actress Jennifer Syme in the late '90s and the couple was even expecting a child together, but their daughter was still-born. Shortly after, the couple split and Jennifer died in a car accident in 2000. He was reportedly married to Winona Ryder on the set of The Guardian, but that doesn't count. However, that doesn't mean he doesn't want kids (or a wife) in the future.</p><p>"I’d like to have a family. I’m getting older and maybe that experience can help you to be the best that you can be to yourself and to another person that you’re with,” he told Parade magazine in 2008. "I think you have to use communication and imagination in a relationship. It’s an imaginative act; it’s an act of creation."</p><p>Today, Keanu dates artist <a href=#>Alexandra Grant</a>. The two took their relationship public in 2019, though it's rumored they began dating a few months prior.</p><h2>Keanu Reeves' highest-grossing movies:</h2><p><a href=#>The Matrix</a> (1999)</p><p>Speed (1994)</p><p>Parenthood (1989)</p><p>Bram Stroker's Dracula (1992)</p><p>The Matrix ReLoaded (2003)</p><p>Dangerous Liaisons (1988)</p><p>Something's Gotta Give (2003)</p><p><a href=#>John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum</a> (2019)</p><p>Matrix Revolutions (2003)</p><p><a href=#>Toy Story 4 </a>(2019)</p><h2>Why is Keanu Reeves popular?</h2><p>It's impossible to not love Keanu Reeves. He has led <a href=#>stranded plane passengers on a road trip</a>, purchased ice cream just so he could <a href=#>autograph the receipt</a> for a fan, and displays the utmost respect for female fans with <a href=#>his no-touching policy.</a> It's no surprise <a href=#>Keanu fan art </a>is also trending.</p><h2>Keanu Reeves net worth:</h2><p>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Keanu is worth an estimated $380 million thanks to his lucrative acting career and side hustles like his motorcycle company, Arch Motorcycles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKxfoLKiutRmqZ6dpprA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ocz-vertex-4-review-256gb-512gb.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>OCZ Vertex 4 Review (256GB, 512GB)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-was-america-born.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How was America born?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
