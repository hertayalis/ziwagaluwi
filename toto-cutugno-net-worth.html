His family soon relocated to La Spezia, Liguria, after his birth.</p><p>He gained worldwide fame for the song “L’Italiano,” which was featured on his eponymous album published in 1983.</p><p>With the song “Insieme: 1992,” for which he also composed the lyrics and music, Cutugno also triumphed at the 1990 Eurovision Song Contest in Zagreb, Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Toto Cutugno career</h2><p>Cutugno started out as a drummer before forming Toto e i Tati at the age of 19. Later, he joined forces with Lino Losito and Mario Limongelli to establish the disco group Albatros.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He also began a career as a songwriter, contributing to some of the most well-known songs by French-American vocalist Joe Dassin, including “Le Jardin du Luxembourg” (co-written with Vito Pallavicini), “Et si tu n’existais pas,” and “L’été indien.”</p><p>He co-wrote songs for Johnny Hallyday, Mireille Mathieu, Ornella Vanoni, Domenico Modugno, Claude François, Gigliola Cinquetti, Gérard Lenorman, Michel Sardou, Hervé Vilard, and Paul Mauriat, as well as Dalida’s “Monday Tuesday… Laissez moi danser” (“Voglio l’anima” in its Italian translation).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/23084141/toto-cutugno-tv-sorrisi-e-canzoni.webp.jpeg><p>With the song “Volo AZ 504”, Albatros placed third at the Sanremo Music Festival in 1976, their first year of participation.</p><p>Cutugno won the competition with the song “Solo noi” (English: “Only us”) when he returned to the Sanremo Music Festival in 1980. However, “L’Italiano” (“The Italian”), a song he perf ormed in 1983, is what most people associate Cutugno with the event.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Cutugno would place second in six additional Sanremo festival competitions: in 1984 with the song “Serenata” (“Serenade”); in 1987 with the song “Figli” (“Sons” or “Children”); in 1988 with the song “Emozioni” (“Emotions”); in 1989 with the song “Le mamme” (“Mothers”); in 1990 with the song “Gli amori” (“Loves,” but 13 times in total, Toto Cutugno attended the festival.</p><p>As a songwriter, during the 1980s Cutugno composed hit songs for numerous artists, notably Miguel Bosé (the Festivalbar-winning song “Super Superman”), Adriano Celentano (“Il tempo se ne va”), Luis Miguel (“Ragazzi di oggi”), Fausto Leali (“Io amo”), Peppino di Capri (“Il sognatore”), Ricchi e Poveri (“Canzone d’amore”), Fiordaliso (“Per noi” and “Se non avessi te”).</p><p>With his original song “Insieme: 1992” (“Together: 1992”), a ballad that praised the European political union and the founding of the European Union, Cutugno won the Eurovision Song Contest in Zagreb in 1990.</p><p>Cutugno frequently performed in New York City and Atlantic City while on tour outside of Italy. He was particularly well-liked in Germany, Russia, Spain, Romania, and Turkey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/23084124/toto-Cutugno.jpeg><p>In 2014, Cutugno was the focus of the Facebook page La stessa foto di Toto Cutugno ogni giorno (literally, “The same photo of Toto Cutugno every day”), which quickly went viral and received thousands of likes, shares, and comments. The case later became the subject of a study by the Institute for Advanced Study in Pavia.</p><p>A group of Ukrainian lawmakers attempted to prevent Cutugno from performing in Kyiv in March 2019 by writing an open letter to Vasyl Hrytsak, the head of the nation’s security services, pleading with him to do so. They described the singer as “a Russian war supporter in Ukraine” and demanded that he prohibit the singer from entering Ukrainian territory.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Toto Cutugno worth?</h2><p>Toto Cutugno had a net worth estimated to be from about $1 million to $5 million.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2mraddmMK1wcanpmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mariah-carey-discusses-rules-locked-away-first-marriage-tommy-mottola.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mariah Carey's candid marriage confession: 'I was locked away'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kin-shriner-leaving.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>General Hospital's Kin Shriner Talks Leaving Scotty for Texas</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
