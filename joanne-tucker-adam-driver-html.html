But, as fans of the Marine Corps veteran might have taken note, the actor is often seen on the red carpet with his beautiful wife, Joanne Tucker.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite the actor flaunting his wife on various red carpets,&nbsp;very little is known about their personal lives. Like many others in the industry, Driver is a fan of keeping his love life away from the public eye. Still, after a little digging, here's what we know about the couple thus far.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Adam Driver Met Wife, Joanne Tucker, at Juilliard</h2><p>Driver enrolled&nbsp;into the University of Indianapolis for a year, after he was medically discharged from the Marine Corps. After his time with the military, the actor had a renewed sense of confidence and hence decided to reapply for Julliard.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>Star Wars</a> actor&nbsp;spoke of his decision to <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">give Julliard another shot</a> in an interview. He said,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>When you get out of the Marine Corps, you feel like you can do anything. That was part of why I went to re-audition for Juilliard. I thought, ‘Worse comes to worst, I know how to live. I’ll live in Central Park or something. I’ll survive.</p><p>Little did he know that his decision would pay off, and he would meet his future wife there. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Driver and Tucker graduated</a> from the esteemed institution&nbsp;in 2009.&nbsp;</p><h2>Adam Driver and His&nbsp;Wife&nbsp;Joanne Tucker Founded AITAF</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After their graduation, Driver and Tucker&nbsp;poured their creative juices into founding and operating an institution called Arts in the Armed Forces, where Tucker still serves as the artistic director.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The duo has since been facilitating "thought-provoking theatre-based troop entertainment" to an audience they claim wouldn't normally choose to indulge themselves in theatre.</p><p>They have done shows across the country, and from what the actor told The Guardian in 2015, they were getting the reactions they'd hoped for.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>They Tied the Knot in 2013</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources with Us Weekly</a>, the couple got married over the weekend of June 22, 2013, at a destination wedding. The source further outed that the attendees included the groom's Girls costar Lena Dunham and her boyfriend, Jack Antonoff.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The source added that the couple was adorable together. They dished, "They've been dating forever, years, and live together; [they're] very comfortable and in love. She was with him before the&nbsp;Girls&nbsp;fame."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The pair also allegedly welcomed a child sometime in 2016. However, the news didn't make it into the mainstream media&nbsp;till 2018, when sources outed to Page 6 that Driver and his wife share a 2-year-old son.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The outlet also reported that close friends of the actor and his wife knew about the pregnancy from the posts that Tucker made on her private Instagram feed.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That being said, the actor had blooped about his child during an interview with W magazine in 2017.</p><p>"I look at my dog — this sounds so absurd — but it’s not — I don’t know if I can love anything more," he said,&nbsp;"Like, I have a kid, maybe — and be like, [gestures dismissively]. But the dog!"</p><p>While it was still difficult to judge if Driver loved&nbsp;his doggo more than he did&nbsp;his own child, it was fair to assume that the actor, who got married at the age of 29,&nbsp;did, in fact, father a child.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKflruvsYytrJyjlad6orDApmSdqpmrsrN6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./doug-christie-isnt-playing-any-games-when-it-comes-to-his-impressive-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Doug Christie isnt playing any games when it comes to his impressive net worth Tue 5 July 20</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./moss-kadey-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Moss Kadey Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2006-dodge-magnum-srt-8.html>2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./clay-wilwert-obituary-dubuque-iowa-community-mourns-his-death.html>Clay Wilwert Obituary, Dubuque Iowa, Community Mourns His Death</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessica-alba-jean-jacket-amazon-7629145.html>Jessica Albas Eras Tour Outfit Included a Fall-Ready Jean Jacket</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./philips-readies-curved-ultrawide-492p8-display.html>Philips Readies Curved Ultra-Wide 492P8 Display: 49, 32:9, USB-C, Sub-$1100</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
