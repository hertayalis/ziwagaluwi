The actress explained to TV Line, the fear of losing Rip over her secret is "too great" to think about.<h2>Who is John Dutton's favorite child?</h2>So much has happened in Yellowstone's first few seasons that it's easy to forget John Dutton had four children in the series pilot. His oldest son Lee was his favorite, and he was the heir to the family business.<h2>Did Jamie get someone pregnant on Yellowstone?</h2>Last week's episode of Yellowstone left some fans wondering, “Is that Jamie's baby and who is that woman?” That woman was Christina (Katherine Cunningham), Jamie's sometime-lover in Season 2.

Then Jamie became a real pariah after learning John had lied to him his whole life; Jamie was actually adopted—he is not a Dutton.<h2>What does the Y brand mean on Yellowstone?</h2>Source: Paramount Network. The "Y" symbol is also supposed to represent a sort of "rebirth" for the individuals who receive the mark. It's no secret that many of the folks who wind up working on the Dutton Ranch have troubled pasts, so getting branded makes them focus on their new lives.<h2>Who married Beth Dutton?</h2>Since 2018, Kelly Reilly has lit up screens as Beth Dutton on the hit show Yellowstone.
