In his senior year, Hill recorded a total of 1,811 all-purpose yards and 11 touchdowns, earning him first-team All-Big 12 honors.</p><p>In 2016, Hill was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. He quickly made an impact as a rookie, being named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week in Week 2 of the 2016 season. He finished his rookie season with 61 receptions for 593 yards and six touchdowns, along with 24 rushes for 267 yards and three touchdowns.

In 2019, there was a child abuse investigation involving Hill and his then-fiancee, but no charges were filed.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Hill continues to be one of the most dynamic and explosive players in the NFL. He is known for his speed, agility, and ability to make big plays, and is considered one of the best wide receivers and return specialists in the league.
