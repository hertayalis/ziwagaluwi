It’s been ten years since Mockingjay Part II was released, and in that time, Jennifer Lawrence’s portrayal of Katniss Everdeen has become an icon of the genre.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>So it’s not surprising that audiences are expecting some sort of nod towards Katniss in the new film, which will be a prequel taking place 64 years before the 74th annual Hunger Games. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ever since the trailer dropped</a>, fans have honed in on Rachel Zegler’s Lucy Gray – and some wonder whether she might be related to Katniss in some way.</p><h3 id=h-what-is-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-about data-injectable=false>What is The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes about?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Blyth-The-Ballad-of-Songbirds-and-Snakes.jpg><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the eve of the 10th Hunger Games</a>, a young Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), alongside several of his Capitol classmates, is tasked with mentoring the incoming tributes. Coriolanus hopes to bring his tribute to glory — it’s the only way for his impoverished family to return to the greatness they once had, before the rebellion against the Capitol left them in ruins.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>To Coriolanus’ consternation, however, he’s tasked with mentoring one of the unlikelier tributes — Lucy Gray, the female tribute from District 12. While she’s charming, and her voice is entrancing, she and Coriolanus have a long journey ahead if they hope to keep Lucy alive.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Who is Lucy Gray?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Hunger-Games-Prequel.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Fans might be surprised to learn that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zegler’s Lucy Gray</a> isn’t the protagonist of the piece — that’s Coriolanus — and many of her actions in the novel are ambiguous and up for debate. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes novel, Lucy Gray — full name Lucy Gray Baird — is a theatrical girl who leads a small band of orphans known as the Covey.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>The Covey were once a nomadic group, but 10 years ago, when the rebellion was lost, those in the Districts were forced to stay where they were — and the Covey had to settle permanently in District 12. Traditionally, the Covey name their children after songs, poems, and colors; Lucy Gray’s name is a reference to the poem by William Wordsworth, which has become an old folk song by this time.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>As the oldest of the Covey, Lucy Gray took it upon herself to support the others, which wasn’t easy in District 12’s harsh environment. Unlike Katniss, she does not have any skill at hunting in the forest, and she references having had to do some difficult things in order to support her family.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Is Lucy Gray Baird related to Katniss Everdeen?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Ballad-of-Songbirds-and-Snakes-Tom-Blyth-Rachel-Zegler-Hunger-Games.jpg><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>While some fans speculate that Lucy Gray Baird is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the grandmother of Katniss Everdeen</a>, it’s actually more likely that another member of the Covey fills this role. The most likely candidate within the Covey is named Maude Ivory, who will be played by Vaughan Reilly in the film.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Maude Ivory is a precocious young girl. She’s mentioned to be a gifted singer — she’s not quite as good as Lucy Gray, but she can remember any tune she hears even once (a skill which could prove important for preserving songs). In addition to being the most prominent member of the Covey — besides Lucy Gray, of course — Maude Ivory makes a passing comment that could indicate she’s Katniss’ paternal grandmother.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>See, Katniss is named after a plant known as an Arrowhead. Her unusual name is actually a nickname for the plant, one that her father loved to snack on. At one point in the novel, Maude Ivory specifically points out the plant and calls it “katniss,” explaining that this is how the Covey refers to Arrowheads. She also makes reference to snacking on the flower — and many of her survival skills are later used by Katniss, 64 years down the line.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Though author Suzanne Collins has not confirmed that Maude Ivory is definitely connected to Katniss, there are several small indications throughout the novel that Katniss’ father is a descendant of the Covey — the same house in which the Covey lives will even eventually house the Everdeens, for example — and Maude Ivory is the safest bet.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=false>So while it’s unlikely that Lucy Gray Baird is Katniss’ grandmother, she does have a connection to the Mockingjay. While there are some more hints about Maude Ivory’s importance to the narrative, knowledge of these hints could be considered a little too spoiler-y. All will be made clearer when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the film finally releases on November 17</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlnKqwunnGq5iyZaKauaLAxJ1kraddoK61usisqmahnmLBqbGMoaynn5WneqitzJ6qZquVp7amv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mariah-carey-has-some-competition-on-tiktok-for-best-christmas-song.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mariah Carey has some competition on TikTok for best Christmas song</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wooden-word-watch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hate Numbers?
